I used flexbox to create the grid, with the intention that it could be used in mobile phones. 

I still need to find a better way for it to interact on mobile phones.

#Important things I learned
1) Design process was: HTML -> CSS -> Flexbox -> JS
2) Double for loops for grid
3) Adding event listeners for each column
